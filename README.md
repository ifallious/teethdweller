# The Teeth Dweller

## The Curse

Long ago, in the forgotten corners of this world, something terrible was born from neglect and decay. It began as whispers in the darkness—stories of those who failed to care for themselves, who let their hygiene slip into oblivion. But these were not mere cautionary tales. They were warnings of a very real horror that lurks in the shadows of poor dental care.

Something dwells within the unbrushed teeth of the unwary. It feeds on neglect, grows in the darkness of forgotten oral hygiene, and waits... always waiting. Those who ignore the simple act of brushing their teeth may find themselves hosting something far more sinister than they could ever imagine.

The Teeth Dweller is not a creature you can see coming. It doesn't announce its presence with roars or footsteps. Instead, it grows silently, feeding on the decay of your negligence. You won't know it's there until it's too late. The only warning is a growing sense of unease, a feeling that something is wrong deep within your mouth—something that shouldn't be there.

When it finally emerges... well, let's just say you'll wish you had taken better care of your teeth.

## What You Must Face

Your survival in this world depends on maintaining proper dental hygiene. Neglect your teeth, and you will face consequences that go far beyond simple cavities. The Teeth Dweller is patient, but it is also inevitable if you fail in your duties.

### The Threat

- **Infection**: If you don't brush your teeth regularly, you risk becoming infected with the Teeth Dweller. Once infected, you'll feel something growing inside you—something that shouldn't be there.
- **The Hatch**: If the infection takes hold and you continue to neglect your oral care, the Dweller will eventually emerge. When it does, you will lose all your teeth, and you won't be able to eat until you get new ones.
- **Prevention**: Regular brushing can delay the inevitable, but once infected, you must maintain constant vigilance. Brushing while infected can extend the time before the Dweller hatches, giving you precious moments to seek help.

### The Solution

The only way to restore your teeth after losing them is to visit a **Dentist Office**. These mysterious structures can be found scattered across various biomes—in forests, jungles, plains, deserts, and more. Within these offices, you may find dentists and receptionists who can help restore what you've lost.

But remember: prevention is always better than cure. Once the Dweller has emerged, you've already lost something precious. Don't let it come to that.

### Manual Toothbrush
**Use**: A basic toothbrush that requires you to complete a brushing minigame to clean your teeth. While it takes more effort, it's the most accessible option for maintaining dental hygiene. Regular use prevents infection and can delay the Dweller's emergence if you're already infected.

**Recipe**:

**How to Use**: Right-click while holding the toothbrush. You must complete a minigame where you brush each tooth by clicking and dragging across them. There is a cooldown period between uses to prevent over-brushing.

### High-End Manual Toothbrush
**Use**: A premium version of the manual toothbrush crafted with gold and iron. Probably made in the same factory using the same brush head but due to the added brand name and gold accents it seems to last way longer.

**Recipe**:

**How to Use**: Same as the regular one but you get to feel fancy ✨

### Electric Toothbrush
**Use**: An advanced toothbrush powered by redstone and precious materials. This superior tool automatically brushes your teeth without requiring the minigame, making it much faster and more convenient. Like the manual toothbrush, it prevents infection and can delay the Dweller's emergence.

**How to Use**: Right-click while holding the electric toothbrush. It instantly cleans your teeth without requiring the minigame, but still has a cooldown period between uses.

### Toothpaste
**Use**: A cleaning agent that enhances your brushing routine. While not strictly required for brushing, it represents the proper tools for maintaining oral hygiene.

## A Final Warning

The Teeth Dweller is patient. It is silent. It is inevitable if you neglect your duties. You may think you have time, that one missed brushing session won't matter. But the Dweller doesn't care about your excuses. It only cares about your neglect.

Brush your teeth regularly. Maintain your oral hygiene. And pray that you never have to face what grows in the darkness of unbrushed teeth.

The Dweller is always watching. The Dweller is always waiting.

Don't give it a reason to emerge.
